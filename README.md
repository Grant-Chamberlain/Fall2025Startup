## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable


For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

If you like to play table top games with friends you have probably used an app to track points or life totals. While it can be convenient to track the numbers online there is always someone sacrificing their device so everyone can see tally. Our website aims to resolve this struggle by hosting live updates to your point tracking. While playing the game anyone present can check in on their device to see the health points, energy counters, or resources available. Now no one needs to give up their phone priviliges to enjoy an easy and efficient board game!

### Design

![Design image](Webdesign.png)


There are a lot of moving pieces to create a tracker for multiple games. Our simple design is made to track the needed counters for up to 6 players. Expansions are on the way for more games and more styles.


### Key features

- Easy Interface to quickly adjust life counts and other tallies in real time
- Live update to all devices so no one has to give up their phone to display the values
- History of games to remember who won and how often 

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - I will use html to display multiple number trackers that are easy to change and quick to refresh
- **CSS** - I will use CSS to make the displays of each player very easy to see and fun to customize
- **React** - I will use react to make it easy to adjust counters and change values 
- **Service** - Used to authenticate users to ensure the data stored is accurate for their games played
- **DB/Login** - DB/Logio will be used to save data for each game the host has played and who has won each game. 
- **WebSocket** - Websocket will be used to update each individual device that is connecting to the current game.
